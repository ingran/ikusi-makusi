### **About the program**

This porgram has been designed for unisg in an Industruino D21G Controller,
with Ind I/O board and a Ethernet Expansion module.
If you want to use all the functions of the Software you should use a SD card.
At the first boot the EEPROM variables will be burnt with the default options.
The default network setting is DHCP, so the it will try to aqquire a IP from
a DHCP server. If it fails to do so in 60 seconds, it will load the 192.168.1.177/24.
Anyway you will be able to see the IP in the screed "Red", at this point you can
access via a web browser and configure all parameters.
